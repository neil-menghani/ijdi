## Building an Environment
Make sure you have Miniconda3 installed. If you prefer not to use Miniconda, you can still run the code in this repository using your Python 3.x environment of choice. Ensure that the dependencies listed in environment.yml are installed.

Open up a bash shell on your Windows, MacOS, or Linux machine

`cd` to this repository folder and use the command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ijdi
```

Launch Jupyter Lab or, alternatively, your Python environment of choice.

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Scripts
The following files, found in the scripts directory, are used by the experiments.

prep.py
scan.py
subset.py
aggregate.py
q.py

## Datasets
The following files, found in the datasets directory, are used by the experiments. See Appendix A.4 for a more detailed description.

COMPAS dataset (Original source: ProPublica; Pre-processed Data from: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis)
compas.csv

German Credit (Original source: Institut f”ur Statistik und “Okonometrie; Pre-processed Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabure/german-credit-data-with-risk?resource=download)
german_credit.csv

## Running COMPAS Experiments
Run the notebooks in the following order to prepare the COMPAS dataset, perform experiments, and generate plots:

Data Prep:
compas_prep.ipynb

Experiment 1:
compas_sim_1_neg.ipynb
compas_sim_1_pos.ipynb

Experiment 2:
compas_sim_2_neg.ipynb
compas_sim_2_pos.ipynb

Mitigation Approach 1:
compas_mit_1_neg.ipynb
compas_mit_1_pos.ipynb

Mitigation Approach 2:
compas_mit_2_neg.ipynb
compas_mit_2_pos.ipynb

Generate Plots:
compas_generate_plots.ipynb

## Replicating the Experiments for German Credit
Run the notebooks in the following order to prepare the German Credit dataset, perform experiments, and generate plots:

Data Prep:
german_credit_prep.ipynb

Mitigation Approach 2:
german_credit_mit_2_neg.ipynb
german_credit_mit_2_pos.ipynb

Generate Plots:
